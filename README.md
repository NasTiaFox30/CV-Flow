# Application:
CV-Flow is a modern, flexible CV (Curriculum Vitae) builder developed using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to quickly create professional documents using ready-made templates (currently 2 are available). The application provides full control over the CV structure thanks to Drag and Drop technology for rearranging main blocks, as well as flexible adding, deleting, and editing of all fields, including photos and text. The final CV is easily saved in PDF format, ready for printing.
